# This repo contain implemention of javascript concepts like throattling and memoization

# Throttling
# Throttling is a technique in which, no matter how many times the user fires the event, the attached function will be executed only once in a given time interval.


# Memoization
# Memoization is an optimization technique used to speed up programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

# The code is written in javascript and can be run in any browser console.

# use cases:
# Throttling:
# 1. Search bar
# 2. Scroll events
# 3. Resize events
# 4. Mouse move events

# Memoization:
# 1. Fibonacci series
# 2. Factorial
# 3. Caching API calls
# 4. Caching expensive function calls
